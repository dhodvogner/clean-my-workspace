# Clean My Workspace

## What is this?

If you like me, you probalby have your "Workspace" or "Projects" folder full with half baked projects, experiments, or other creations.

The goal of Clean My Workspace is help you oversee your own chaos with magical features like:
- Listing when was the last time you made any modifications
- Checking that the project has any repository in it's package.json
- Clean up node_modules folder and free up some space
- And other more exciting ones, wich I didn't figured out yet.

## Sounds awesome! What's next?

```bash
$ npm i clean-my-workspace -g
$ cmw
# Follow the instructions
# Wait until the server starts, then open your browser at: http://localhost:3000
```

## Running locally

```bash
$ npm start
# Follow the instructions
# Wait until the server starts, then open your browser at: http://localhost:3000
```
